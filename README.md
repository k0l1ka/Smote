Synthetic Minority Over-sampling TechniquE is implemented and analyzed in this project based on the article (SMOTE.pdf).

Other basic methods of classification improvement on imbalanced datasets are implemented too.
They are compared via ROC AUC values and ROC curves.

One should run file "main.py" (Python 3.6) to get plots that will be saved in folder Smote.     

Theoretical basis of implemented methods and used metrics are briefly described in presentation. 
There are also comparative plots thata were generated by the code.
